# CodeVoice

Voice Enabled Coding Assistant is a project aimed at addressing the challenges faced by software developers with repetitive strain injuries (RSI) or visual impairments. The project aims to create a coding environment that allows programmers to write code using voice recognition, reducing the need for typing and improving accessibility for individuals with disabilities.

## Introduction
Programming environments often involve a significant amount of typing, which can be problematic for developers with RSI or visual impairments. Additionally, learning the syntax of a new programming language can be challenging for both novice and experienced programmers. The Voice Enabled Coding Assistant project aims to alleviate these issues by enabling programmers to use speech recognition to write code and generate standardized code in the Java programming language.

## Problem Statement
The text-oriented nature of programming languages poses a barrier for individuals with arm disabilities who wish to pursue programming careers. This project aims to enable programmers with arm injuries or disabilities to write code using voice recognition, reducing the reliance on typing and improving accessibility. The project also aims to simplify the process of learning the syntax of a new programming language.

## Objectives
The main objectives of the Voice Enabled Coding Assistant project are:
1. Enable programmers with arm injuries and visual impairments to write code using voice recognition.
2. Ease the process of learning the syntax of a new programming language.
3. Reduce repetitive strain injuries (RSI) associated with typing.
4. Accelerate the software development process.
5. Assist programmers in remembering syntax by generating standardized code.

## FEATURES

**1. Punctuation:** The Cross editor supports punctuation input, allowing you to easily add punctuation marks such as periods, commas, question marks, and more.

**2. Existing Symbols:** The editor also includes a wide range of existing symbols, such as mathematical symbols, currency symbols, arrows, and special characters, making it convenient for various types of writing and programming tasks.

**3. New Symbols:** In addition to the existing symbols, the Cross editor introduces a set of new symbols specifically designed to enhance your writing experience. These new symbols can help you express complex ideas, emotions, and concepts more effectively.

**4. Mouse Free Operation:** The Cross editor offers a unique mouse-free operation feature, allowing you to perform various actions and commands without the need for a mouse. This feature is particularly useful for users who prefer keyboard-only navigation or have limited mobility.

**5. Cross Sr:** Cross Sr (Shortcuts and Recommendations) is an intelligent feature that suggests relevant shortcuts and recommendations based on your context and writing patterns. It helps streamline your writing process by providing quick access to frequently used commands and suggesting helpful actions.

**6. Cross Editor:** The Cross editor provides a seamless and intuitive writing environment with advanced functionalities, such as customizable themes, split-screen view, collaboration tools, and more. It offers a smooth and efficient writing experience for both individual and collaborative projects.

## System Architecture
The system is divided into several modules:
1. User Interface: Provides an interface for users to interact with the system.
2. Voice to Text Converter: Converts spoken words into text using speech recognition.
3. Code Generator: Generates standardized Java code from the converted text, applying Java syntax and semantics.
4. Speech Recognition: Utilizes the SpeechRecognition library to retrieve audio input and convert it into text.
5. Special Program Constructs: Generates specific program constructs if a match is found between spoken words and reserved Java words.

## Feasibility Study
The feasibility study examines the technical, economic, and operational aspects of the project. The Voice Enabled Coding Assistant project has been found to be technically feasible, as it utilizes existing systems and tools such as Java Development Kit and Python. It is also economically feasible, as it does not require additional costs beyond the existing text-oriented systems. Additionally, the project has been found to be operationally feasible, with users perceiving the system as user-friendly.

## Software Requirements
The software requirements for the Voice Enabled Coding Assistant project include:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK) 8.1
2. Python IDLE 3.7

## Conclusion
The Voice Enabled Coding Assistant project aims to improve accessibility and productivity for programmers with arm injuries or visual impairments. By leveraging speech recognition and generating standardized code, the project aims to reduce typing and assist programmers in learning and utilizing programming languages effectively. With its user-friendly interface and focus on accessibility, the project seeks to empower individuals with disabilities to pursue careers in programming.
